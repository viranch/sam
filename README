1) On LINUX Platforms:
	Make sure you have python and pyqt packages instlled before proceeding.

	Get the source code from http://bitbucket.org/viranch/sam or clone the repo:
	$ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/viranch/sam
	Note: if the above command doesn't work, you need to install the package "mercurial",
	otherwise get the code from the above link.

	Run the following commands:

	$ cd path/to/source

2) On Windows Platform:
	Contact the authors to get the windows installer. (It's free too)
	Just run the setup.exe
	SAM is ready to use by invoking from desktop shortcut or start-menu shortcut.
