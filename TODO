TODO List:

1. [DONE] Do login/quota/logout requests in threads so that SAM doesn't seem to be get hanged.

2. MainWindow is in tray, open settings from tray menu, click OK or Cancel, SAM segfaults. Fix this.

3. Have dynamic quota limit. Right now SAM deals only with 100MB quota limit. Handle other limits and no-limit cases.

4. Elegant saving of settings using QSettings instead of savePrefs everytime.
